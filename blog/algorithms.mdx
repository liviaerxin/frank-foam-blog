# Algorithms

As it is known that algorithms and data structures are the prime of computer programming. With algorithms and data structures, the better high-level features in applications we can develop and implement. The Better algorithms means faster time and less space, and the best case is consuming both O(1) time and O(1) space. 

Of course, you'll go through algorithms questions in a lot of interviews for programming-related positions.

Here are proofs for the correctness of some common algorithms, that I'd like to understand and prove them in mathematics.
