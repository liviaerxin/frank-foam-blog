# Generate self-signed SSL/TLS certificate for local IP address or local domain

In real life, when we build our website and make it public, some paid or free CA(Certificate Authority) will help us sign a certificate for our website domain and enable SSL/TLS connections from user browser to our server.

For secure reasons, the browser will only admit those servers's certificates signed from authorized CA, of which certificate is kept in your host system trust store.

:::note
One of the most popular Certificate Authorities is [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), which is a free and non-profit CA.
:::

Here is an example, we will generate a local server certificate that is signed by a local CA. Finally, let Chrome can visit our local website without security warning.

In brief, these steps we need to sign local sever certificate actually simulate how those CA sign certificates for public servers, as following:

1. Create a local **Root CA**.
2. Create a **CSR**(Certificate Signing Request) file for local server `127.0.0.1`.
3. The local **Root CA** use the **CSR** to generate a **certificate** for local server `127.0.0.1`.
4. Install the local **Root CA** into our system(Windows, Ubuntu or macOS) trust store.
5. Run a simple **https** server to test local server **certificate**.

For those official CA, they have to validate the domain is owned by the server before the `step 3`, and we can ignore `step 4` as they are already installed into the system or the browser trust store.

And there is nice picture from [How to create your own self-signed root Certificate Authority(CA)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-your-own-self-signed-root-certificate-shankar-gomare/) to show the relationship between `CA`, `server` and `browser`.

## Create root Certificate Authority(CA)

Generate `RootCA.key` and `RootCA.crt`:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -new -sha256 -days 1024 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout RootCA.key -out RootCA.crt -subj "/C=US/CN=Example-Root-CA"
```

You can change `Example-Root-CA` to others or add more fields to CA.

## Create local server certificate

Next, we should apply the local CA to sign a certificate for our local server, which will be accessed through the `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` from our local machine.

### Generate Certificate Signing Request(CSR)

Set up custom DNS in `/etc/hosts`,

```conf title="/etc/hosts"
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.0.1   fake1.local
127.0.0.1   fake2.local
```

Prepare a `localhost.conf`,

```conf title="localhost.conf"
[req]
default_bits  = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = req_ext
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[req_distinguished_name]
countryName = XX
stateOrProvinceName = N/A
localityName = N/A
organizationName = Self-signed certificate
commonName = 127.0.0.1: Self-signed certificate

[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
IP.1 = 127.0.0.1
DNS.1 = localhost
DNS.2 = fake1.local
DNS.3 = fake2.local
```

Generates `localhost.key` and `localhost.csr`:

```sh
openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -config localhost.conf
# Or input from line
# openssl req -new -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=Example-Certificates/CN=localhost.local"
```

Verify the Certificate Signing Request(CSR) `localhost.csr`:

```sh
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in localhost.csr
```

### Get local server certificate signed by root CA

Submit **CSR** to the **root CA** to let the **root CA** to sign a certificate for our `locahost` server.

Generates `localhost.crt` by using CSR `localhost.csr` with extensions,

```sh
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 1024 -in localhost.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -extensions req_ext -extfile localhost.conf -out localhost.crt
```

View the `localhost.crt`:

```sh
openssl x509 -text -noout -in localhost.crt
```

Verify the `localhost.crt`:

```sh
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile RootCA.crt localhost.crt
```

:::warning
If `X509` extensions(`subjectAltName`) are missing from the certificate, the browser will still report security issues.
:::

:::note
Using the CA and Subject as the same one, the step of creating the local CA can be skipped.

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -config localhost.conf
```

:::

## Use the server certificate

Run up a node https server to use the generated local server certificate.

```sh
npx http-server -p 8082 --ssl --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key
```

Then visit:

- https://127.0.0.1:8082/
- https://localhost:8082/

The browser will give you security warning as the local **root CA** is not trusted in default.

## Trust the root CA

Install CA certificate `RootCA.crt` into each system trust store or each browser.

- Windows system trust store
- Ubuntu system trust store
- macOS system trust store

Then visit again, the browser will show green!

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome **red** security warning

1. Go to `Developer Tools`.
2. Click `Security` tab.
3. Check `Security overview` issues.
