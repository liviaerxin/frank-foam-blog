# Python Celery

What's **workflow** in Celery?

In **Celery**, **workflow** is composed of multiple **tasks**, and a **task** is deemed to be a universal unit of the **workflow**, as a function in the program. In **Celery**, it's recommended to divide a long-running task into multiple short-running tasks. **workflow** comes out to help ease the orchestrations of the work, such as `chain()` three tasks.
