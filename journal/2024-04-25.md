## Travel mugs for dishwasher safer

But there is nothing that will bring you down off the high of a good meal faster than seeing the dishes stacked up in your sink. If you have a dishwasher in that moment, it can be your **saving grace**, but it can not do it all.

A sink full of plates and glasses can get loaded into the standard dishwasher and come out looking spotless. However, there are still plenty of items that you should be washing by hand. Cast iron or non stick pans can get ruined in dishwashers, wooden spoons can warp and crack, and knives can be damaged and dull.

### Insulted travel mug

Also on the list is your favorite **insulted travel mug**. 

The reason for this, according to Report, is that the hight water pressure and extreme heat cycles can damage their precious vacuum seal -- and if the seal is damaged, your favorite travel mug will lose its insulting properties.

### Stainless steel mug

The **Contigo** Travel Mug User Guide states the following:
- Lid and any UNPAINTED stainless steel body are top-rack dishwasher safe. HAND-WASH ONLY any PAINTED stainless steel body.
