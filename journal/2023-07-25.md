- [ ] Authentication and Authorization in Microservices

Authentication in microservices involves two main occasions:

1. authentication required when end users communicate with services.
2. authentication happens between internal services.
3. authentication needed when external services enter internal services.

OAuth 2.0 provides the industry-standard protocol for authorizing users in distributed systems. The OAuth framework reduces the burden on developers, eliminating duplications to build their own authentication mechanism in each microservice.
