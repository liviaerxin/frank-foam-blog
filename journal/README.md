## Terminology

[Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic)

## Tech Vocabulary

- trivial program
- trial program
- experienced engineer

## Mathematics Vocabulary

- associative
- commutative
   a × b = b × a
   a + b = b + a
   a ^ b = b ^ a
- division
   `/`: divide
  `%`: mod
  dividend / divisor = quotient
  dividend % divisor = remainder
  dividend / divisor = (quotient) R (remainder) : dividend divided by the divisor has a quotient and a remainder
  5 / 3 = 1 R 2: 
  5 divided by 3 has a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2

## Here's a category of topics commonly used in backend software engineering:


Backend software engineering interviews often cover a broad range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, system design, database management, networking, and more. Here's a categorization of some common terms and topics:

   - Message queues and asynchronous processing
   - Proxy servers

7. **Server:**
   - HTTP protocol, RESTful APIs
   - Web server concepts (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
   - Authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
   - Session management and cookies
   - Web security best practices (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
   - ORM
     - active record
     - data mapper

8. **Concurrency and Parallelism:**
   - Multi-threading and synchronization
   - Locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores)
   - Concurrent data structures (e.g., concurrent hash maps, queues)
   - Parallel processing frameworks (e.g., MapReduce)

9. **Programming Languages and Frameworks:**
   - Proficiency in at least one backend programming language (e.g., Java, Python, Go, Node.js)
   - Frameworks and libraries commonly used in backend development (e.g., Spring, Django, Express.js)
   - Understanding of asynchronous programming and event-driven architectures

10. **Python:**
   - Data Structure
      - list
         - `append(v)`, `pop()`: O(1)
         - `insert(0, v)`, `pop(0)`: O(n)
      - dict
      - deque
         - `append(v)`, `pop()`: O(1)
         - `appendleft(v)`=`insert(0, v)`, `popleft()`=`pop(0)`: O(1)
   - Typing
   - Interactive shells
      - rich
      - IPython
      - bpython
      - ptpython

11. **DevOps:**
   - Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack)

12. **Testing:**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - End-to-end testing

13. **Debugging:**  
   - Debugging techniques and tools (e.g., logging, debugginggers)
   - Performance profiling and optimization

14. **Software Development Practices:**
   - Version control systems (e.g., Git)
   - Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
   - Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)
   - Code review processes and best practices

15. **Cloud Computing and DevOps:**
   - Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)
   - Containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack)

16. **Other Topics:**
    - Design patterns (e.g., singleton, factory, observer)
    - Object-oriented design principles

## GPT 3.5 vs GPT 4.0

3.5 is used for general purpose, creating an essay.
4.0 is more analytical and more logical and more precise.

I use 3.5 to create general letters, essays, posts, etc.
4.0 is more for deeper questions & outputs.

3.5 is much faster than 4.0.

foremost

C is a good language to learn for a career. 

. It is a foundational/**primitive** language that is still widely used in areas such as operating system, compiler/interpreter and low-level libraries.


Thanks for listening to my rant.
