[ ] I still prefer **os.path** over **Pathlib**, as follows

1. Consistency, I'm used to use path string as an argument between functions and I think **Pathlib** is not flexible enough to handle arguments
2. Pure and Function, Although **Pathlib** brings many useful features like `glob`, `stem`, and so on. I still like the concept of simplicity that don't put all things together!

[ ] Some common issues I often hit when using **git**

Configure username/password for different repos or remotes

Global configuration

```sh
git config --global --list
git config --local --list
```


**GIT** two popular authentication methods:

- ssh key

[How to Authenticate Your Git to GitHub with SSH Keys](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-authenticate-your-git-to-github-with-ssh-keys)

- username/password credentials

Enable credentials storage in your Git repository

```sh
# local
git config credential.helper store
# global
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Each credential is stored in `~/.git-credentials` file on its own line as a URL like:

```sh
https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@github.com
```

Configure credentials,

```sh
# Global
git config --global credential.https://github.com.username <your_username>

# Or 
git config --local user.name <your_username>
git config --local user.email <your_useremail>
# Then git pull or git push to let it cache your username/password after it prompt you to input password in the first time
```


Alternatively, we can directly edit our global Git config file `~/.gitconfig`,

```sh
[credential "https://github.com"]
	username = <username>
```
