## PDF vs Word

PDF: Fixed layout, non-editable.
Word: Editable, variable layout.

## PDF vs JPEG image

Indeed, **PDF** is primarily optimized for text-based content with vector graphics, while images, particularly in formats like **JPEG**, excel at representing complex visual content like photographs or intricate illustrations. If the content is highly visual or complex, using an image format like **JPEG** may be more appropriate, even if it results in a larger file size.

## Which is more efficient to store text? PDF or JPEG?

In terms of file size efficiency, **PDF** is generally smaller as it stores text as **vector data** or **text macros**, whereas **JPEG** stores text as **pixels**. So, for the same text on the same layout, a PDF would typically be smaller in file size compared to a JPEG image.

## Layout view

In a **layout view**, from large to small:

- **Window:** A graphical area on a screen that displays content or user interface elements. It can contain one or more panes, panels, or tabs, depending on the application's design.

- **Pane:** A division within a window that separates and displays different sections of content. Panes can be resizable and can contain various elements such as panels, tabs, or other UI components.

- **Panel:** A specific area within a pane that typically contains controls, information, or tools related to a particular aspect of the application or document being viewed.

- **Tab:** A navigational element often used to switch between multiple documents, views, or sections within a single window. Each tab typically represents a separate content area or document within the same window.

Other terms related to layout views might include:
- **Frame:** A designated area within a window or pane where content can be displayed or arranged.
- **Viewport:** The visible area of a document or interface within a window or pane, especially when the content is larger than the available display space.
