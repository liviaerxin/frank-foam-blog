## iPhone Photo Backup in External Storage & macOS Photos App Management

Backup photos into macOS Photos Library in external storage, while you can manage the macOS Photos Library

Here is how I streamline photo management in my iphone:
1. Prepare your storage device: it's recommended to format the storage device for Mac: APFS format.
1. Create Photos Library on External SSD: a Photos Library folder contains all data needed to manage the photos
2. Move photos in iphone by the macOS Photos app: These photos will be backup to the Photos Library on External SSD

## Backup Photo into NAS

1. Setup a home NAS.
2. Upload your original photos from iPhone to a NAS folder.
3. A background sync application will organize these photos into separate folders based on years/months.
  1. The app can read metadata in photos.
  2. The app can copy full data in photos.
  3. The app can skip copying if finding same file.
  4. The app can keep the photo file created/modified timestamp.
