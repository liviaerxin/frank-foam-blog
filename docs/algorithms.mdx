# Algorithms

As it is known that algorithms and data structures are the prime of computer programming. With algorithms and data structures, the better high-level features in applications we can develop and implement. Outstanding algorithms means faster time and less space. `O(1)` on both of time complexity and space must be the best as taking the constant time and the constant space, but it's rarely to achieve in practice. Next, `O(log n)` is mostly desirable for most applications on real occasion.

Of course, you'll go through algorithms questions in a lot of interviews for programming-related positions.

Here are proofs for the correctness of some common algorithms, that I'd like to understand and prove them in mathematics.

## Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm

Just run one loop to find the majority in an array.

Time complexity: `O(n)`
Space complexity: `O(1)`
