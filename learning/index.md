## Excellent Resources

There are some very useful and reliable resources where I frequently enquire and review.

[The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide â€” The Linux Kernel  documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/)
    - Exhaustive knowledge about Linux kernel

[nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/)
    - Linux documents on  **How to** serials.

I love **ChatGPT**:
    - When delving into a knowledge basic point, there are always a series of doubts one after one, and I used to shaping my understanding by solving these doubts. Nowadays `ChatGPT` come to save me a lot of time and improve the accuracy, especially sometimes I can't give an precise prompt but `ChatGPT`can `guess` accurately what I want to ask. After all doubts in my mind are solved, the knowledge is also engraved in my mind.
    - ChatGPT is good at illustrating details even line by line or option by option from popular tools. For instance, you can pick up `Make` that you have learned but have forgotten because you've not used it for a long time or frequently.
    - ChatGPT can provide concrete and accurate sample codes for **HOW-TO**. Nowadays there are so many specifications in a tool but my brain has finite memory capacity, so what I need to do is just remembering the key points/features of the tool to retrieve the details/how-tos.

In the beginning of year 2024, ten years after I graduated with a bachelor degree of **information and computing science**(a.k.a: **Computational mathematics**, which a major in the department of mathematics) and then started my career as a beginning software programmer, I skipped the computer science fundamental learning. Now I start going deep into the compiler, and learn how to write a compiler from scratch. The tony compiler is to interpret mathematical expression.

Then I come across the confuse:
How ChatGPT do arithmetic operations? Is it quit different with the traditional interpreter?
