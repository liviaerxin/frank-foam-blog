ChatGPT
    - When getting deep into a knowledge point, I'll have a series of doubts one after one, and I used to shaping my understanding by solving these doubts. Nowdays `ChatGPT` come to save me a lot of time and improve the accuracy, especially sometimes I can't give an precise prompt but `ChatGPT`can `guess` accurately what I want to ask. After all doubts in my mind are solved, the knowledge is also engraved in my mind.
