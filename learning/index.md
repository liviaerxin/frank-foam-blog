## Excellent Resources

There are some very useful and reliable resources where I frequently enquire and review.

[The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide â€” The Linux Kernel  documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/)
    - Exhaustive knowledge about Linux kernel

[nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/)
    - Linux documents on  **How to** serials.
