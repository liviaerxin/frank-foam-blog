## Excellent Resources

There are some very useful and reliable resources where I frequently enquire and review.

[The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide â€” The Linux Kernel  documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/)
    - Exhaustive knowledge about Linux kernel

[nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/)
    - Linux documents on  **How to** serials.

I love **ChatGPT**:
    - When delving into a knowledge basic point, there are always a series of doubts one after one, and I used to shaping my understanding by solving these doubts. Nowadays `ChatGPT` come to save me a lot of time and improve the accuracy, especially sometimes I can't give an precise prompt but `ChatGPT`can `guess` accurately what I want to ask. After all doubts in my mind are solved, the knowledge is also engraved in my mind.
    - ChatGPT is good at illustrating details even line by line or option by option from popular tools. For instance, you can pick up `Make` that you have learned but have forgotten because you've not used it for a long time or frequently.
    - ChatGPT can provide a concrete nearly-accurate sample instantly. Nowadays there are so many specifications in a tool but my brain has finite memory capacity, so what I need to do is just remembering the key points/features of the tool to retrieve the details/how-tos.
